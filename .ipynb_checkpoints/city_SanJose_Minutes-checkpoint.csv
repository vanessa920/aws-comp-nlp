6.2 20-048 Electric Mobility Strategy Update. (Cont’d)   

   Accept staff report with the following additional direction: 

 

   1. Return to the Transportation and Environment Committee by June 2020 with a: 

      a. Draft ordinance allowing for one-way carsharing that could provide flexibility for 

      these vehicles to park in residential parking permit zones; and a 

      b. Fee structure for one-way carsharing vendors; and a 

      c. List of potential requirements new vendors who would like to serve communities 

      in San Jose must comply with, including: 

         i. Establishing a low-income discount program that offers discounted 

         memberships to individuals at or below 200% of the federal poverty level; and 

         ii. Including communities of concern in the home zone; and 

         iii. Providing outreach and marketing materials in Spanish and Vietnamese, 

         and to tenants in multi-family housing. 

   2. Explore options for incentivizing electric vehicle (EV) carsharing programs by, 

   among other things: 

      a. Reducing parking and permit fees; and 

      b. Ensuring access to EV charging; and 

      c. Identifying and pursuing grant opportunities. 

   3. Explore a pilot program with an EV infrastructure manufacturer, carsharing company, 

   and an affordable housing developer to operate an EV carsharing program in a new 

   affordable housing project. 

   4. Return by June 2020 with an updated Green Fleet policy that includes an  

   “electrification first” requirement for the city’s non-emergency fleet that aligns with our  

   Climate Smart goals. 

   5. Return to the Transportation and Environment Committee by June 2020 with 

   recommendations for electrifying the city’s remaining non-electric fleet where 

   technologically feasible. 

      a. The analysis should include: 

         i. A lifecycle cost analysis of replacing all non-electric vehicles with EVs within 

         the next 5 years, and the charging infrastructure required to support it. 

      b. For vehicle types where there isn’t a commercially available battery electric 

      option available, identify and pursue grant funding for pilot programs. 

   6. Explore an electric school bus demonstration project in partnership with Prospect  

   Silicon Valley, San Jose Clean Energy, DOT, and a school district. The project will  

   explore additional benefits for the school bus to provide backup power to critical  

   facilities in the event of a Public Safety Power Shutoff. 

   7. Where relevant, ensure marketing strategy, community engagement, and education 

   efforts on all recommendations under the Electric Mobility Roadmap are culturally 

   competent, with a specific focus on environmental justice, including communities of 

   color, monolingual communities, and low-income communities. 

      a. This work should leverage existing community engagement efforts underway as 

      part of Climate Smart San Jose. 

   8. Explore the creation of a Financial Counseling Program, in partnership with a 

   community-based organization and San Jose Clean Energy, that promotes the economic 

   empowerment and feasibility of electric mobility for low-income communities.

Accept the Vision Zero Action Plan and related budget actions, with the following 

additional direction: 1. Develop a geospatial data tool for Vision Zero analytics, insights, and predictive
modeling to inform Vision Zero policies, programs and projects as recommended in the

action plan. In addition, future work on data analytic tools should include:

a. Integration with My San Jose App1. Work with the City Manager's Office of
Civic Innovation to identify a potential feature in the upcoming update to My San Jose 

for residents to report unsafe streets. 

b. Nudging tools1. Identify potential nudging tools in partnership with private sector
partners, like Waze, that could be used to make drivers more aware near Vision Zero 

corridors, and emerging priority geographies. 

c. Expanding Data Capture and Analysis

i. Include data on future growth trends within Vision Zero corridors to assess

potential impacts.

5.1 20-134 Transportation Safety Vision Zero Action Plan. (Cont’d) 
ii. Identify potential private sector partners that may have data that could be used to

develop a more holistic understanding of crashes in Vision Zero corridors.

iii. In addition to all relevant traffic collision data and emergency response, the data tool

should incorporate equity indicators, including homelessness, overcrowded

neighborhoods, income, and other socio-economic factors that provide a clearer picture

of which communities are being most impacted by collisions.

iv. Return to Council with an evaluation of whether we might reconsider geographic

targeting of traffic safety resources if we evaluated collision risk per traffic volume,

rather than merely identifying those corridors with the highest number of KSI collisions,

as more fully described below.2. Form the Vision Zero Taskforce, and appoint Councilmember Peralez as the Chair.
The Taskforce will meet quarterly, be composed of partner agencies and community

based organizations, and report to the Transportation and Environment (T &E) and

Public Safety, Finance and Strategic Support (PSFSS) Committees on Taskforce

activities, trend analysis, and initiatives.3. Return with an MBA in the budget process to evaluate Traffic Enforcement Unit
staffing options including redeployment or potential ways to increase staffing –

specifically for evenings and weekends where we don't have traffic enforcement but

have the highest incidence of traffic collisions resulting in fatalities or severe injuries.

Report updated staffing plan to the PSFSS and T &E committee.4. Retain a consultant to design a community engagement strategy and messaging
campaign. Staff should leverage outside partners, messaging platforms, and strategies in

this effort, as well as engage Council Offices and Commissions as channels to raise

awareness in the community. The campaigns should be culturally inclusive and offered

in multiple languages, with careful consideration given to the elderly population, the

largest segment of pedestrian fatalities statistically, and our homeless neighbors.5. Accelerate ""quick-build"" project implementation, and grow the Vision Zero Safety
Initiatives funding in the Traffic Capital Fund to implement traffic safety improvement

projects along priority safety co1Tidors (PSCs) by:

a. Pursuing funding from Measure B, One Bay Area Grant, State Active

Transportation Program, and other sources; and 

b. Exploring flexibility in allocating regional and state pavement maintenance

funding for Vision Zero safety improvements in years 2021/22 and beyond; and 

c. Joining other cities in advocacy for a loosening of federal rules to enable use of

Airport-generated TNC revenue to fund traffic safety improvements elsewhere.

potential modifications to the Priority Setting process, incorporating the following elements and 

suggestions. Any changes will not be implemented until the next Priority Setting session, in 2021.  

 

(1) Alignment with Council Reorganization and Budget (a) Evaluate the desirability of 

establishing a 2-year Priority Setting cycle. The process could begin shortly after the 

reorganization of the Council and conclude with the adoption of the budget. This would provide 

staff with two fiscal years to accomplish the priorities. (b) Continue aligning the Priority Setting 

process with the budget process to ensure priorities are integrated into the budget. (c) Continue 

providing annual progress reports, at minimum, coinciding with the Mid-Year Budget Review or 

another appropriate opportunity. These may allow for minor modifications to the priorities as 

needed.  

(2) Strategic Planning (a) Explore opportunities to incorporate greater strategic planning into the 

Priority Setting process. For example, consider a 2-step process in which the Council first 

establishes high-level, thematic goals, potentially with measurable outcomes. Then, the Council 

identifies specific projects that would achieve those thematic goals. (b) Priority projects unrelated 

to the thematic goals may be added to the workplan if sufficient resources and staff capacity are 

available 

(3) Assessment of Resources and Staff Capacity (a) To provide a more transparent and realistic 

assessment of available resources and staff capacity, include other ongoing projects in the 

workplan that is developed through the Priority Setting process. These projects would include 

those identified in the General Plan, Climate Smart San Jose, the Housing Crisis Workplan, and 

other major plans, initiatives, and programs that contribute to staff workload. (b) Organize priority 

projects, including those identified through 3(a), by City Service Area (CSA). This will help 

ensure a more equitable distribution of projects across City departments.

 This meeting will be adjourned in honor of Dr. Jerrold “Jerry” Hiura. Dr. Jerry was an important and  
 spirited community leader, a tireless force in San José's arts and cultural community and also a popular  
 family dentist.  Dr. Jerry was among the first appointees to City of San José's Arts Commission, and a  
 co-founder of the Contemporary Asian Theatre Scene (CATS). He spent his life passionately involved in  
 bringing diversity to organizations at the local and state levels, with a particular interest in promoting the  
 work and growth of Asian artists. At the time of his passing, he and his wife Lucia Cha were serving as  
 trustees on the board of San Jose Museum of Art. Dr. Jerry’s memory is cherished by his wife Lucia Cha,  
 mother Dorothy, sister Barbara Hiura, and also leaves behind step children, their spouses and  
 grandchildren.

 Recommendation: (a) Direct the City Attorney to prepare a resolution, an ordinance, and a companion  

 urgency ordinance providing for a temporary moratorium on evictions in the City of San  

 Jose for renters on the basis of nonpayment of rent (“affected renters”) where that  

 failure to pay rent results from wage loss resulting from the novel coronavirus  

 (COVID-19) pandemic, under the following conditions: 

  (1) Ordinance will become effective upon Council adoption of a resolution declaring  

 that the moratorium is effective due to the declaration of the County Public Health  

 Officer, or other State or Federal Authority, of an emergency related to COVID-19; 

  (2) The temporary moratorium shall remain in effect for a period of thirty (30) days  

 from the Council resolution, but the City Manager shall return to enable Council to  

 consider an extension to a longer period as the circumstances dictate;  

  (3) The temporary moratorium must not extend beyond the duration of the City’s  

 Resolution, but may be extended for a longer period by agreement of the Council; 

  (4) Affected renters must demonstrate substantial loss of income, through  

 documentation or other objectively verifiable means, resulting from the COVID-19  

 pandemic or the declaration of the County Public Health Officer, or other State or  

 Federal Authority e.g., from (a) job loss, (b) a reduction of compensated hours of work,  

 (c) store, restaurant, or office closure, (d) the need to miss work to care for a  

 home-bound school-age child, or (e) other similarly-caused loss of income that resulted  

 since the City’s Resolution; 

  (5) Affected renters must notify their landlords on or before the day that rent is due that  

 they have substantial loss of income as a result of the declared emergency related to  

 COVID-19, resulting in business closure, substantial loss of compensable hours of work  

 and wages, or layoffs. 

  (6) The legislation shall include findings of potential job loss, wage loss, or other  

 impacts for specific industries-such as hotels, conventions,-or theaters:-resulted from  

 the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 (b) Direct the City Attorney to evaluate the potential for including in such legislation a

   4. In measuring substantial loss-of-income, claimants will have the choice of comparing 

   earnings of the month when losses are claimed against the earnings of the previous  

   month or the median average of earnings for the three months immediately prior. If this  

   urgency ordinance is extended and relief is sought for additional consecutive months,  

   future losses shall be measured against the same baseline of expected income chosen  

   initially; 

 

   5. Renters must make a good faith effort to pay any portion ofrent that they are able with 

   their reduced income, after accounting for recurring personal expenses and without 

   having to dip into personal savings; and

   considered in assessing an individual's ability to pay rent - personal savings, 

   investments, or the value of property in their possession will not be relevant.

 diversity to organizations at the local and state levels, with a particular interest in promoting the work and  

 growth of Asian artists. At the time of his passing, he and his wife Lucia Cha were serving as trustees on the  

 board of San Jose Museum of Art.  Dr. Jerry’s memory is cherished by his wife Lucia Cha, mother  

 Dorothy, sister Barbara Hiura, and leaves behind step children, their spouses, and grandchildren.

amendment was accepted by the makers of the motion. 

Action:  On a call for the question, the motion carried unanimously, staffs’ recommendations were 

accepted, including Councilmember Lan Diep’s memorandum dated March 12, 2020 (with item e. 

amended as noted): to bring much-needed relief to small businesses in San Jose adversely impacted 

by COVID-19, approve direction to the City Manager to: 1. Take the following actions: a. Work 

with our Congressional delegation to urge the Trump Administration and the Small Business 

Administration to formally declare a disaster stemming from COVID-19 infections in Santa Clara 

County or geographic region that includes Santa Clara County so that federal assistance may be 

directed here specifically; b. Reach out to the Governor’s office to request priority for Santa Clara 

County over any state or federal assistance dollars, reflecting our heightened vulnerability; c. 

Through the 2020-2021 Budget Process, set aside funding for our Office of Economic Development 

so they can build the capacity to: i. Provide technical assistance to small businesses eligible for 

SBA loans; ii. Become a singular resource for small businesses in need to learn about the various 

private and government relief programs available to them; d. Reach out to the Silicon Valley 

Community Foundation and corporate partners in San Jose such as Google, Cisco, Adobe, and 

Apple in attempt to create a relief fund to give grants assisting small businesses impacted by 

COVID-19 to cover employee wages, rent, and other fixed costs similar to the $5M fund Amazon 

has created for Seattle; e. Reach out to the Silicon Valley Organization, other ethnic and minority 

chambers of commerce, and small business owners to create a Small Business Advisory Recovery 

Task Force to advise us on policy recommendations and assist with outreach to the business 

community; f. Reassess the purpose of Work2future to see what additional resources they may need

commercial leases for small businesses. 2. ADD “Work with the small business advisory task 

force” Establish an Office of Small Business, or full-time point of contact, within OED and/or City 

Hall that would provide assistance and guidance to small businesses in emergency situations such 

as the COVID-19 outbreak; designate a full-time employee/s for this role or partner with a 

nonprofit organization to provide direct and timely communication to small businesses, including 

recommended management practices in response to COVID19, resources available to help mitigate 

the impact of the health crisis and preserve business continuity, such as federal loan opportunities 

through SBA, unemployment assistance through State’s Employment Development Department 

(EDD), tax relief, and technical support. 3. To complement federal and state funding, reserve funds 

to establish a Business Continuity Fund of $2 million that would support small businesses, which  

includes “mom and pop” landlords, that can demonstrate a direct loss due to the COVID-19 

outbreak through no-interest loans for small businesses and grants for micro-businesses (new 

enterprises or sole proprietorships with no more than two employees). Tenants and Landlords  4. Per Councilmember Arenas’ memo of March 9, 2020, direct the City Manager to bring forward

described above. • Any employer not permitted to operate or employ people at a California work

and local mandates. • Small Business Administration loans and technical assistance, such as: o 

Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act which provides forgivable loans under $10

   Vice Mayor Chappie Jones reminded the community that the Rent Suspension proposal 

   had been withdrawn to calm the overwhelming concerns voiced by speakers during  

   public comments. 

 

 Mayor Liccardo called a cessation to new public comments at 11:30 p.m. as Council 

would vote on no proposal tonight. 

 

   Councilmember Raul Peralez stated the need to skirt the Rules and Open Government  

   Committee and directly agendize a rent freeze item for Council consideration that would  

   obligate landlords in receipt of some form of mortgage relief to ensure that a portion of  

   such relief transfers down to the tenant at a bare minimum.  

 

   City Attorney Rick Doyle iterated that, while Council will not debate the merits of this  

   item or any specifics on taking action on it, the Brown Act does allow the Council to  

   direct staff to bring back a future agenda item within the subject matter. 

 

   Action: The motion by Councilmember Raul Peralez to agendize rent freeze on the next  

   City Council Agenda, on Tuesday April 14, 2020, seconded by Councilmember  

   Magdalena Carrasco, passed unanimously, including the deferral of the Memorandum  

   from Councilmember Carrasco and Councilmember Peralez, dated April 3, 2020.

 • OPEN FORUM 

 
1. Jose Manuel Valles: commented on interpretation of the constitution, and the use of police power 2. Blair Beekman offered comments on permitting public commentary on the rent item. 3. Eric Tapier addressed how the road to hell is paved with good intentions, socialism, and central planning. 4. Victor Vasquez expressed disappointment with today's decision, because the public is not asking the City  
 to give the public something for free but to protect our interests. 
5. Veronica, East Side District 5 resident, urged Council to support a rent suspension for the people, and use  
 the power the people gave the Council to protect the most vulnerable. 
6. Avi Shai commented that this is unfair because the landlord and the tenant are in the same difficult  
 situation.  
7. Annie stated that many people are hurting and are barely hanging on. Housing is a human right and a  
 moratorium is the only logical solution. 
8. The person with the phone number ending 1367, addressed item 10.1: Land Use on Consent Calendar,  
 and the 14 ordinance-size trees that are to be removed.  
9. Bill stated that we should help tenants and property owners alike; landlords should not always be picked  
 upon to sacrifice. 
10. Fay recounted her client’s case, a tenant who is a software engineer with a tech company, and he just  
 paid 60 percent of the rent without any job impact on his income at all. 
11. Joseph Magno, a postal carrier and organizer in the Filipino community stated that the City cannot ask  
 The most vulnerable communities to stop working without suspending rent.  
12. Mark Andrews commented on extending a helping hand to landlords and the poor alike.  13. Brenda spoke to anxiety among us all struggling residents, seniors, undocumented class, and all races  
 who are counting on the City to find options and solutions that would help everyone.  
14. Wey Gao commented that he and his wife have three young kids to bring up, and rely on the only rental  
 property they have to help them overcome today’s financial crisis.

8.1 (Cont’d.)  
 

Councilmember Sylvia Arenas offered a friendly amendment to the substitute motion, requesting the 

inclusion of the memorandum from Councilmember Magdalena Carrasco.  The friendly amendment 

was accepted. 

 

Action: Upon motion by   Resolution No. 79480 extending the temporary moratorium to May 31, 2020 

on evictions due to nonpayment of rent for residential tenants where the failure to pay rent results from 

income loss resulting from COVID-19 was adopted. Including: 

 

The memorandum from Councilmembers Carrasco and Peralez, dated April 10, 2020, to “1. Direct the 

City Attorney to return with an emergency ordinance that would impose a moratorium on rent increases 

for units subject to the Apartment Rental Ordinance (ARO) during the declaration of the national 

emergency; and 2. Explore retroactivity to April 1st, 2020. 3. Explore the extension of a moratorium on 

rent increases to Mobile Homes”; with additional language to extend the rent freeze and repayment 

period for affected tenants with a sunset of December 31, 2020 instead of effective from the time of 

adoption to 120 days after the Eviction Moratorium expires. 

 

Including the memorandum from Mayor Sam Liccardo, dated April 13, 2020 to “1. Accept Staff’s 

recommendations included in their Memorandum dated April 10, 2020. 2. As part of the Rent Increase 

Freeze Ordinance, in order to encourage landlords to temporarily discount rents during this pandemic 

emergency, direct the City Attorney to include in the ordinance that any agreed upon rent decrease 

between landlords and tenants during the rent freeze period shall not affect the tenancy’s initial rental 

rate for purposes of impacting future rent increases. 3. As part of the Stakeholder Convening, direct City 

Staff to outreach to the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley for their recommendations 

on alternative solutions for the rental community impacted by COVID-19.” With additional language 

“Not only Terner, but other thought partners as well”. 
 

Also including the memorandum from Vice Mayor Jones, dated April 13, 2020: to “a) Accept Staff 

Recommendation A. b) Modify Staff Recommendation B to direct the City Attorney to include in the 

Urgency Ordinance and Companion Ordinance the following: 1) a rent freeze on all new rent increases 

for rent stabilized apartments and mobile homes. The timeline for the rent freeze shall run parallel to the 

eviction moratorium and rent repayment period. 2) a landlord rent reduction incentive that ensures any 

temporary rent reduction during the COVID-19 crisis does not impact “base rent” for future rent 

increase consideration for rent stabilized apartments. 3) a fee waiver for all Apartment Rent Ordinance 

(ARO) late fees. Additionally, a fee waiver for building/repair maintenance permit fees for rental 

properties under 20 units. c) Consider a Council led task force to initiate a convening of stakeholders 

representing landlords and tenants to explore alternative solutions to address the needs of our rental 

community impacted by COVID-19. The task force could be modeled after the District 1 facilitated 

Small Business Advisory Task Force. 
 

And including the memorandum from Councilmember Magdalena Carrasco, dated April 10, 2020, to 

“I. Modify eviction moratorium to include the following additional protections for tenants: (1) prevent 

landlords from serving an eviction notice on a tenant if they have reason to know that the tenant is 

currently impacted by COVID-19; (2) prevent a landlord from evicting a tenant because the tenant has 

been infected or is suffering from COVID-19, under the pretext of another viable reason for eviction 

such as owner move-in, breach off agreement, or a COVID-19 related nuisance; (3) after a tenant has 

been served notice from a landlord, allow tenant up to 7 days to provide a notice informing the landlord  

 

(Item Continued on the Next Page) 



 

 City of San José Page 13  April 14, 2020

that they have been impacted by COVID 19; and (4) protect tenants unable to provide COVID-19-

related documentation to landlords from harassment and retaliation under section 17.23.1270 Anti 

Retaliation Protections of our City’s moratorium. II. Direct staff to craft a template affidavit that tenants 

can submit in cases where tenants are unable to provide any other verifiable evidence of their COVID-

19-related impacts, as is often the case with undocumented individuals working in the informal 

economy.” 

 

Also including Item 5 from the memorandum cosigned by Councilmembers Khamis, Davis, and Foley, 

dated April 13, 2020 to (5) Deny tenant petitions for rent decreases for service reductions related to the 

elimination of common area amenities such as pools, gyms, etc., if these amenities we closed in order to 

comply with County or State public health orders related to COVID-19.

 Adopt a resolution repealing and replacing Resolution No. 79450 (modifying public

 (a) Allow only the City Manager-not Mayor and Council Offices-to request the City  

 Clerk place an item on the City Council Agenda after the date of the hearing of the  

 Rules Committee, but at least 72 hours prior to the meeting, in compliance with the  

 Council Rules of Conduct Resolution No. 79367 Rule 3(d), which requires 2/3 vote of

   procedures for adjusting items through the Orders of the Day.

   through to get the Council. Therefore, what’s recommended in the current agenda item 

   is not any different than the rules that would typically apply under Council Resolution 

   77135, (or the existing Consolidated Open Government and Ethics Provisions) as  

   adopted, and referenced herein, which has been in place since 2014.

   Councilmember Dev Davis, and carried unanimously, Resolution No. 79485 was  

   adopted, and staff report, approved.

 (b) Allow Councilmembers and the Mayor to have the City Clerk place an item on the  

 City Council Agenda under Orders of the Day after the date of the hearing of the Rules  

 Committee, but at least 72 hours prior to the meeting, if the Clerk utilizes the procedures  

 authorized in Consolidated Open Government and Ethics Resolution (“Sunshine  

 Resolution”) No. 77135, Section 2.3.2.1.E to allow items to be so added if the Mayor,  

 City Manager, and City Attorney concur that the item requires immediate action, and

 enter into a voluntary short-term agreement, without changing other terms of the rental  

 contract, to temporarily reduce the rent through the term of the Ordinance, or shorter  

 period as agreed-upon by the parties;

 recreational common area amenities to comply with County or State public health orders

   addition to always having a good attitude and great sense of humor, Reggie’s work in  

   processing and receiving the City's mail has been vital to organizational operations, in  

   terms of keeping the City functions going. Furthermore, Reggie has undertaken  

   additional duties such as taking on the bids that come in from vendors so the City can  

   accept and process those bids.

   Emergency Operations Center provided updates, including efforts to expand testing and  

   tracing of COVID-19 cases, the City’s road to financial recovery, and progress in

  for an ordinance that anticipates future revisions of County health guidelines to provide  

  local businesses-particularly restaurants- access to public space and private adjacent

 or 

   ii. “by right” permit in designated geographic locations that will not require additional  

 processing. 

  b. Waive sidewalk café permits/fees to allow restaurants and other appropriate  

 businesses to operate outside seating and service for customers who comply with the

  c. Work with San Jose SPUR to identify ideal geographic locations for use of private  

 parking lots, public parks, alleys, plazas, and streets for outdoor business activities,

   City Manager David Sykes provided updates regarding the City’s response to  

   COVID-19. The City Manager recognized an extra-ordinary individual, Walter Lin,  

   Deputy Public Works Director that oversees fleet facilities and radio division in public  

   works. He has been involved with securing PPE for our City employees, collaborating  

   with local breweries to manufacture needed hand sanitizer as well as with setting up the  

   covid-19 testing sites. In addition to setting up temporary shelters for our un-housed  

   community. Further, Walter and his team have been involved with modifying  

   workspaces and all the cleaning protocols to keep all our city facilities and employees  

   safe; and has been running the EOC Logistics Branch. Walter is a very quiet leader,  

   with an unparalleled work ethic. 
 

   Deputy City Manager Kip Harkness, and the leadership team from the City’s  

   Emergency Operations Center provided updates, including acknowledging exceptional  

   City staffing and discussed recent EOC efforts to provide childcare and summer camps,  

   bolster financial recovery resources for the community, and resume fire inspections. 
 

   San José Fire Department Chief Robert Sapien provided highlights of a recent wildfire  

   in south San José and the response of multiple departments and agencies. The City has  

   provided administrative leave to benefited employees since March 17, 2020, who are  

   unable to work due to the County’s shelter in place order and the corresponding closure  

   of City programs and facilities, employees’ own illness, instruction to quarantine, caring  

   for an ill family member, and employees affected by a school closure. However, all City  

   employees have recently been notified by email on June 10, 2020, that the City has  

   decided to end the provision of administrative leave for COVID-related absences once  

   an employee exhausts the 14-calendar days of leave that qualifies as Emergency Paid  

   Sick Leave (EPSLA). This change will take effect June 28, 2020

 for what is commonly referred to as “crowd control”:

3.6 20-673 Discussion and Actions Related to Police Use of Force and Crowd Control (Cont’d) 
 

 (1) Officers in significant numbers (eg: two dozen or more) in “riot gear”. 

 (2) Tear gas. 

 (3) Kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs) such as rubber or foam bullets. 

 (4) “Flash-bang” devices. 

 (5) Use of batons and/or physical contact. 

 (b) For each of the days/ episodes in which any of these approaches were deployed  

 during the recent protests, describe in specific detail the circumstances that gave rise to  

 the decision to uses of any of these methods or uses of force since May 29. 

 (c) In light of recent experience, indicate what changes to the Duty Manual the  

 Department should or will consider to any of these policies or protocols for crowd  

 control. 

 (d) Either at today’s meeting or at the earliest possible opportunity, indicate why  

 Council should not prohibit the use within dense crowds of kinetic impact projectiles  

 (KIP), i.e., rubber of foams bullets, either by directing the City Manager to amend the  

 SJPD Duty Manual, or alternatively directing the City Attorney to amend San José  

 Municipal Code Section 10.32. Specifically: 

 (1) Reveal whether the safety of KIP design or composition has substantially improved  

 since the time of the studies referenced in this memorandum, below; 

 (2) Describe the approximate number of rounds discharged in crowds over the past  

 week; 

 (3) Explicitly evaluate the relative imprecision of this tool, and its likelihood of striking  

 persons other than its intended targets; and 

 (4) Compare options, including (a) other less-than-lethal tools, other than a batonstrike; 

 (b) substantially reducing the frequency of their use by raising the threshold justifying  

 discharge, and (c) an assessment of whether any alternative KIP composition will  

 reduce the risk of harm to members of the public. 

 (e) To provide greater transparency to the public and accountability: 

 (1) For the approximately half-dozen video clips that have raised substantial public  

 concern on social media regarding potential SJPD misconduct or possible unlawful use  

 of force, release to the public any videos in possession or readily available to SJPD that  

 provide a fuller picture of the incident, such as longer duration (particularly the period  

 prior to the video clip in question), alternative view angles, etc., within two weeks, so  

 long as consistent with what is allowable under California state law. 

 i. Those videos should include, at a minimum, 

 • the incident involving the collision between the police motorcycle and the running  

 pedestrian, and 

 • the incident involving a physical altercation between police and a male who is pulled  

 back behind the police line by multiple officers, and subjected to repeated blows by  

 police, and 

 • the incident involving an officer responding to a protester with expletives 

 (2) At the earliest opportunity for public hearing-whether at our upcoming Independent  

 Police Auditor use of force review or for the after-action report-- public hearing, present  

 to the Council and public the IPA and SJPD findings relating to investigations and  

 investigation reviews of each of those clips.

3.6 20-673 Discussion and Actions Related to Police Use of Force and Crowd Control (Cont’d)  

 (f) Establish a process, consistent with that advocated by the Obama Foundation’s My  

 Brother’s Keeper Alliance Mayoral Action Pledge, to review our “use of force” policies,  

 engage our community, seek the feedback of our community on the findings, and reform  

 those policies consistent with the best thinking nationally. The process should engage  

 the entire community, including faith leaders, social justice advocates, leadership within  

 our communities of color, criminal justice experts, the police union, the police  

 rank-and-file, the Chief of Police, and the Independent Police Auditor. 

 (g) Return to Council by the first week of August with ballot language articulating the  

 expansion of authority for the Independent Police Auditor. This language should  

 provide a higher level of transparency and accountability over “use of force”  

 investigations and access to police records, including body worn camera footage, as  

 achieved through negotiation with the Police Officers’ Association. Further explore  

 additional expansion of IPA authority within the legal parameters mandated by the  

 California Supreme Court’s decision in Seal Beach Peace Officers Association v. Seal  

 Beach. This can include language to allow for future expansion of authority through a  

 meet and confer process that doesn’t require a Charter Amendment.

   his readiness to work with the Department to release information per the California  

   Public Records Act request or voluntarily. This will be implemented on a case by case  

   basis and to the extent there aren't litigation and/or claims filed. There might be grounds

 [Deferred from 6/9/2020 - Item 8.1 (20-630)] 
 

Economic Development Assistant Director, Nanci Klein and Deputy City Manager/Director of 

Economic Development Kim Walesh gave a presentation and responded to questions. 

 

Public comments: Members of PACT, Mary Helen Doherty, Reverend Ray, and Katherine Alexander; 

Priscilla (Working Partnerships) and a representative from LUNA offered support to keeping the 

Commercial Linkage Fee separate to create more equity in housing. Mathew Reed (SV@Home), Mary 

Murtagh (EAH Housing) and Robert Geary opined that setting a cap is not a good policy at this time. 

Matt (SOMOS/Mayfair) urged minimizing future delays on the commercial linkage fees; Scott Knies, 

San José Downtown Association, recommended holding off on setting a cap and keeping Diridon fees at 

the current rate.  Erik Schoennhauer suggested pipeline exemptions. Members of the Law Foundation of 

Silicon Valley Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and Silicon Valley Organization offered support to 

staff recommendations and the Mayor’s memorandum, agreeing with a fee cap and no new 

infrastructure fees. Blair Beekman advocated for facilitating more progressive ideas.  

 

Motion: Councilmember Raul Peralez moved approval of his memorandum and the memorandum from 

Mayor Sam Liccardo, both dated June 15, 2020.  Mayor Sam Liccardo seconded the motion.

8.4 (Cont’d.)  

Councilmember Dev Davis requested a friendly amendment, asking for a moratorium on fee increases 

for the basic infrastructure impact fee until the end of 2021. Councilmember Raul Peralez respectfully 

declined, and Council discussion followed. 

 

Action:  Upon motion by Councilmember Raul Peralez, seconded by Mayor Sam Liccardo and carried, 

Resolution No 79585, approving an Economic Recovery Temporary Cap on New or Increased 

Infrastructure Fees for Development was adopted, including the June 15 2020 memorandum from 

Mayor Sam Liccardo, to: 1. Accept staff recommendation to cap the Diridon Basic Infrastructure Impact Fee with the 
following revision and clarifications: 

a. Revise the staff recommendation to state that there will be no imposition of new 

infrastructure fees until after January 1, 2023. This does not apply to a Commercial 

Linkage Fee, which will be addressed separately. 

b. Clarify that the fee cap applies to all building permits, including foundation, as is 

the current practice. 

c. Clarify that the Diridon Basic Infrastructure Impact Fee is subject to an increase (in 

geography, and in the amount up to the cap) before 2023. However, any changes 

would go through the normal community engagement process, which includes a 

review of the required nexus and feasibility study. 

 

Also including Councilmember Raul Peralez memorandum dated June 15, 2020, accepting staff 

recommendations with the inclusion of a Cap on the Commercial Linkage Fee (CLF) rate at $20 per 

square feet for Office/R&D on September 7, 2020 if staff does not return to Council by September 3, 

2020 with a CLF fee recommendation. Allow the rate cap to remain in effect alongside the temporary 

infrastructure fee cap for building permits issued before January 1, 2023.

The Council recessed at 1:03 p.m. and returned at 2 p.m. with all Council members present.

 Heard before Consent 
 

   City Manager David Sykes provided updates regarding the City’s response to  

   COVID-19. The City Manager highlighted some of the great work being done by City  

   staff, including the San José airport staff, for their great job in keeping travelers safe and  

   the performance of efficient operations to ensure the public is safe. The airport  

   technology team was responsible for helping all our employees that couldwork from  

   home. The facilities and engineering team deployed safety measures throughout the  

   terminals including deep cleaning facilities, installing plexiglass guards, as well as  

   designing and building sanitation stations throughout the airport. The team helped  

   maintain relationships and connections with all partners at the airport, including the  

   Airlines and the Concessionaires. The Planning and Development team continued to do  

   the work around moving forward with the masterplan approved by the Council in April.  

   Also, the Marketing and Communications team did a great job of social media and other  

   Forms by connecting with the public to instill trust and confidence that City’s airport is  

   safe. The City Manager showed a short video clip of the City’s airport team effortlessly  

   performing the operations to keep the airport running during this time.  

 

   Deputy City Manager Kip Harkness and the leadership team from the City’s  

   Emergency Operations Center provided updates including a focus on the City’s  

   roadmap of ensuring compliance with the public health order, continuing city services,  

   supporting those most at risk as well as an update on testing work with the county and  

   where we are in terms of looking ahead at the reopening process. The City moved to  

   Stage 6 of our Pandemic Response Plan, (Planning for Re-Opening of City Services and  

   Facilities), earlier this month.  As Santa Clara County continues to ease restrictions  

   under its Shelter-in-Place Order, he noted the Emergency Operations Center is working 

closely  

   with City departments to plan for the re-opening of City services and facilities that were  

   previously shut down.  Stage 6 in the 10-stage plan is the City’s preparation phase for  

   when more services and facilities re-open in Stages 7 and 8 of the Pandemic Response  

   Plan progression.

Jones agreed to the amendment.

accepted by Councilmember Johnny Khamis, acceptance of the friendly amendment was later withdrawn by

Mayor Sam Liccardo provided opening comments. Assistant City Attorney Ed Moran noted the 
replacement memorandum provided contained no substantive changes, only a footnote change due to a 
typographical error, and indicated revisions made to the proposed ballot measure. As Councilmember 
Maya Esparza indicated she would like to hear the presentation in full, Deputy City Attorney, Mark 
Vanni, offered the complete presentation on the proposed Charter Measure. 
 
The availability of interpreters for both Spanish and Vietnamese were announced. City Clerk Toni Taber

Vice Mayor Chappie Jones memorandum; items #1, #3 and #4 from Councilmember Sylvia Arenas 
memorandum, and items #2 and #3 from the memo she coauthored with Councilmember Maya Esparza.  
The motion was seconded by Councilmember Maya Esparza. 
 
Following discussion and clarification from Assistant City Attorney Ed Moran, Councilmember Sylvia 
Arenas requested a friendly amendment to make changes to item 2(a) from Vice Mayor Chappie Jones, 
which was not accepted by the maker and seconder of the motion. 
 
Substitute Motion: Councilmember Sylvia Arenas moved Items 1-5 from her memorandum; Items 1 a, b and 
c from Mayor Sam Liccardo’s memo; Vice Mayor Chappie Jones memorandum with the exception of 2(a), 
and Items #2 and #3 from the memorandum submitted by Councilmembers Carrasco and Esparza.  
Councilmember Raul Peralez seconded the motion.  
 
Councilmember Maya Esparza offered a friendly amendment, requesting that Item 2(a) from Vice Mayor 
Chappie Jones’ memorandum be revised, to “Scope of Work of the Blue Ribbon Commission shall include: 
(a) Consideration of GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE provisions INCLUDING THOSE consistent with the 
“Mayor-Council” government structure found in other cities in the United States in which the Mayor has 
executive authority and the Council has legislative authority.” The amendment was accepted by 
Councilmembers Arenas and Peralez. 
 
Council discussion resumed with ideas of which ballot items should be combined and the role of the Charter 
Review Commission/Blue Ribbon Task Force. 
 
Council recessed at 11:58 a.m. and reconvened at 1 p.m. with all Council members present. 
 
Councilmember Raul Peralez offered a friendly amendment, to eliminate recommendation #5 from the 
memorandum from Councilmember Arenas’ memorandum; to not require the Redistricting or Planning 
Commission initiatives to be bundled with the IPA reforms; and submitting 2b, c and d from the Mayor’s 
memorandum for vetting by the Board of Fair Campaign and Political Practices and the Charter Review 
Commission. After further discussion, additional verbiage was added, including whether the next term is 2 
years or 6 years to be decided upon by the Charter Review Commission and to be included in an election in 
Spring of 2022. The friendly amendment was accepted by Councilmember Sylvia Arenas. 
Councilmember Raul Peralez asked that these items, in totality, be turned over to the Charter Review 
Commission/Blue Ribbon Panel and Board of Fair Campaign and Political Practices for vetting; and it was 



 

 City of San José Page 4 July 28, /2020 

determined that items regarding the Planning Commission Initiative and Redistricting Initiative be 
bifurcated. The amendment to the motion was accepted, including bifurcation. 
 
Action: On a call for the question the motion carried unanimously, with Councilmember Sylvia Arenas July 
27, 2020 memorandum accepted as revised, including both items from Vice Mayor Jones’s memo  as 
amended to Direct staff to create a Blue Ribbon Commission within 60 days according to the following: 1. 
Parameters for the Blue Ribbon Commission shall include: a) 23 Members to be appointed by Council and 
Mayor subject to the following criteria: i. Each Council Member is to nominate two members residing in 
their Council District; ii. Mayor to nominate three at-large members, including the Chair of the 
Commission, who is to vote only when there is a tie vote; iii. Vice Chair of the Commission is to be elected 
by the Commission once comprised. b) Composition of Commission Members is to represent a cross-
section of backgrounds and professions including, but not limited to: labor/union, business and 
development, academia, legal, and government. c) Commission is to determine number of meetings, number 
of public hearings, and schedule of meetings. d) Commission is to provide recommendations to Council for

Staff members of City Attorney and Clerk’s Offices.  2. Scope of Work of the Blue Ribbon Commission 
shall include: a) Consideration of governance structure provisions including those consistent with the 
“Mayor-Council” government structure found in other cities in the United States in which the Mayor has 
executive authority and the Council has legislative authority. b) Evaluation of transition of the election cycle 
for odd-numbered districts to align with the presidential election cycle and the even-numbered districts with 
the gubernatorial election cycle. c) Consideration of additional measures and potential charter amendments 
as needed, that will improve accountability, representation, and inclusion at San Jose City Hall.  Additional 
direction was to direct staff to refer the proposed campaign finance reforms, commission reforms, and 
lobbyist restrictions to the Charter Review Commission/Blue Ribbon Panel and San Jose’s Board of Fair 
Campaign and Political Practices for consideration and recommendation to review for the 2022 election 
cycle, holding either a) an election for a six-year term or b) a special two-year Mayoral term that would not 
count against term limits. Bring back their recommendations for appropriate council action. Additionally, 
approve Item #2 from the joint memorandum from Councilmembers Esparza and Carrasco, dated July 24, 
2020, to (2) Create a Blue Ribbon Task Force to research and solicit community input on strong mayor and 
other potential charter reforms to improve and update our governance structure, and including 2a from 
Mayor’s Memo “Align mayoral executive authority with residents’ and local business’ reasonable 
expectations for responsive and accountable democratic governance in a major U.S. city”. 
 
Bifurcation of the two charter revisions, Planning Commission Initiative and Redistricting Initiative 
followed. (11-0). 
 
Redistricting: 
Action: Upon motion by Councilmember Sylvia Arenas, seconded by Councilmember Raul Peralez and 
carried unanimously, Item #5 from Councilmember Sylvia Arenas memorandum was accepted, directing 
staff to revise the Redistricting Charter Amendment to allow it to address potential future situations 
involving census delays. 
 
Referencing the Planning Commission Initiative, Councilmember Dev Davis requested a friendly 
amendment, requesting council-wide participation in commissioner selection, rather than each 
councilmember selecting their own delegate. Councilmember Sylvia Arenas initially declined the friendly 
amendment, but following Assistant City Attorney Ed Moran’s clarification to the selection process, 
Councilmember Arenas reconsidered and accepted the amendment from Councilmember Davis.

 Activity with no commitment to a specific project which may result in a potentially  
 significant physical impact on the environment. (City Manager) 
 
   City Manager’s Chief of Staff Lee Wilcox, gave a presentation and responded to  
   question for the negotiation team, consisting of Assistant City Manager Jennifer  
   McGuire, City Attorney Rick Doyle, Assist Police Chief Dave Knopf, Assistant City  
   Attorney Nora Frimann, and Senior Executive Analyst Anna Szabo.  
 
   The proposed ballot measure related to card rooms to be before San Jose Voters during  
   the November 3, 2020 election is aimed at increasing City’s revenues as well as  
   increasing card rooms’ competitiveness. 
 
   Councilmember Davis sought clarifications on regulations about card rooms operations  
   in relation to Title 16 and the associated costs to fund gambling addiction services, as  
   well as the 3 percent annual increase to the two hundred fifty thousand dollars’ annually  
   the card rooms must funnel to a nonprofit a group to mitigate gambling addiction.  
 
   Mayor Liccardo highlighted the various elements of the potentially three ballot  
   measures to be placed on the ballot and referenced the costs-analysis contained in the  
   Memorandum from City Clerk, Toni Taber, dated August 3, 2020.  
 
   Mayor Liccardo observed that there are at least four, (if not six) pros and cons  
   arguments that every voter will likely see in the measure, even without rebuttal  
   arguments, and encouraged the Council to take the short and near terms budgetary  
   implications of these measures into account  
 
   Assistant City Attorney Ed Moran explained that there will be arguments for, and  
   against and there will be a response to each one of those.  
 
   Mayor Liccardo cited various social issues associated with gambling as the main 
   reasons he’s not in support of the measure. He stated that proximity matters, but  
   studies from National Opinion Research Center found that adults living within short  
   driving distance of a casino had double the probability of pathological problems  
   associated with gambling. Symptomatic of the general outcomes are: spikes in  
   aggravated assault and rape rates, domestic violence, suicide, and child neglect, to  
   mention but a few. 
 
   Action: Upon motion by Councilmember Sylvia Arenas to move approval, seconded by 
   Councilmember Raul Peralez, and carried unanimously, Resolution No. 79657 was  
   adopted, including approval of staff recommendation to:  
   Adopt a resolution of the City Council:

 3.5 20-828 Actions Related to Potential Ballot Measure(s) for the November 3, 2020 (Cont’d)  
   Council has the option of taking the components both separately, or jointly; the IPA  
   separately and then putting the Planning Commission and the Census ballot measure on  
   a separate one.  
 
 • Council recessed for dinner at 5:43PM 
 • Council reconvened at 6:01PM 
 
   Public Comments: Offering comments were: JT, Carrol Watts, (representing the League  
   of Women Voters); reverend Nanci Palmer-Jones, (Senior Minister of the First  
   Unitarian Church of San José and a member of PACT); Blair Beekman, and Paul Soto. 
 
   Councilmember Maya Esparza observed that, the community's voice is an important  
   element in the ballot measure discussion. The community want their voices heard in the  
   public dialogue we’re going to be having around IPA powers, Police Reforms, Planning  
   Commission, and other important discussions. Therefore, she sought clarifications on  
   community engagement process and the public's role in that process. 
 
   City Manager David Sykes and Employee Relations Director Jennifer Schembri  
   stated the City will explore ways to c get some input from the community.  
 
   Mayor Liccardo observed that section 411 of City Charter deals with the City  
   Managers’ non interfering and administrative authority. Council seeks to be certain that  
   there is no language in City Charter, and/or nothing about passing an Ordinance that  
   would give investigatory authority over police misconduct case to the IPA, so that the  
   IPA don’t conflict with 411 in the execution of it duties.  
 
   Council had a productive and comprehensive debate. Staff was directed to search for,  
   and/or look at the language in the Charter and if there is any specific language that  
   delegates the City Manager’s investigatory authority afforded it. 
 
   It was observed that the motion for this item has been made. Council resolved to move  
   on to other items on the agenda, with notation that additional time is required before  
   taking a vote. Council will return to the motion and vote on it. The City Attorneys will  
   check the Charter and ensure Council feels relatively confident there's no trip wire to  
   trigger a crisis.  
 
   Upon motion by Vice Mayor Chappie Jones to table this item until later in the meeting,  
   seconded by Councilmember Maya Esparza, and carried unanimously, vote on the item  
   was deferred until later in the evening, with clarifications that Council will come back to  
   that motion.  
   (11-0.)  
 
   Council returned to Item 3.5 with Mayor Liccardo restating review of the Charter  
   provisions and posing the question relating to anything in the Charter that would create  
   a contradiction or would undermine efforts of the Council to enact a muni code  
   provision that would empower the IPA with investigation authority.

 3.5 20-828 Actions Related to Potential Ballot Measure(s) for the November 3, 2020 (Cont’d)  
   Assistant City Attorney Ed Moran confirmed review of the Charter and see no provision  
   that would directly prohibit the granting of the IPA additional authority for  
   investigations. 
 
   Mayor Liccardo then clarified for the record that, whereas section 411 clearly indicates  
   that Council cannot meddle in the administrative matters of the City Manager without a  
   Council vote, Section 411 would not, and does not stand as a barrier to Council  
   enactment of a muni code provision that would invest the IPA with investigation  
   authority. 
 
   Action: Upon motion by Vice Mayor Chappie Jones to move approval, seconded by 
   Councilmember Sergio Jimenez, and carried unanimously, Resolution No. 79659 was  
   adopted, and staff report, accepted. Further clarification was given to combine all three  
   components, (IPA, Redistricting and Planning Commission), into one, with no rebuttals.  
 
   It was also agreed that, synopsis will be published in the Mercury News and City  
   website[s], not the full text. Additional clarification was given to delete “Unreacted”,  
   that precedes officer-involved shooting as written in staff report as follows: 
 
   [Consolidated with IPA]:  
 
   Shall the City Charter be amended to: expand the Independent Police Auditor’s  
   oversight, including unredacted review of officer-involved shootings and use of force  
   incidents causing death or great bodily injury, review of department-initiated  
   investigations against officers, and other technical amendments; increase the Planning  
   Commission to 11 members with Council appointing one member from each Council  
   District and one “at-large” member; and allow the Council to establish timelines for  
   redistricting when Census results are late.   
 
   Also approved was designation of Mayor Liccardo as a member of the Council to write  
   the argument in favor of the ballot measure. In accepting the task, the Mayor offered to  
   work with Council Offices of Members Peralez and Khamis in drafting any arguments  
   as indicated in approval of Item 3.4 above.  
 
   The City Council did not approve including the full text of the measure in the ballot.  
   Further, the City Attorney was directed to prepare an impartial analysis, and the City  
   Clerk was directed to move forward with submitting the ballot and any other action  
   necessary to put it on the ballot for November 2020.

week as follow up. 6. . Blair Beekman: commented on local democracy, and demilitarization of the Police Dept., which he said would lead to less harassment of everyday ordinary people. 

 
•  Adjournment 
 

 This meeting is in memory of Carmen Castellano, a dedicated activist for social change,  
 community leader, and lover of the arts. Through her thirty-five years at San José City College,  
 where she co-founded the Latino Education Association, and as the founder and President of the  
 Castellano Family Foundation, Carmen was a trailblazer, uplifting communities of color and  
 elevating Latino voices. As a philanthropist, Carmen fiercely advocated for greater diversity,  
 equity, and inclusion within philanthropy, and has left an indelible legacy reflected in the many  
 local organizations she supported. She is survived by her husband, Alcario, their three children,  
 Maria, Carmela, and Armando, and five grandchildren.

   complaints about officers, as well as about policies and procedures or the lack thereof. 
 

   Police Chief Edgardo Garcia stated that Police Departments needs to examine how to  

   improve using local and national examples.  
 

   Mayor Liccardo acknowledged the enormity of public engagement on this issue and  

   emphasized the importance for policymakers to recognize the inherent complexity of the  

   issues confronting the City, and noted SJPD is one of only two hundred departments, in  

   the entire country that has any kind of independent review over internal affairs  

   investigations in the form of an IPA.

   Councilmember Esparza sought clarifications on when to expect to receive the IPA  

   Annual Report and a confirmation of when it will come to Council.  

 

   Independent Police Auditor Shivaun Nurre cited delays caused by COVID-19 and lack

   complaints voiced during public comment as valid feedback from residents.

   calling 408-794-6226, by email to ipa@sanjoseca.gov, or via the online form at:

 Recommendation: Accept a report detailing the public release of video clips from the recent protests that  

  are in the possession of or readily available to the Police Department. 

 CEQA: Not a Project, File No. PP17-009, Staff Reports, Assessments, Annual Reports,

 [Deferred from 8/5/2020 - Item 4.1 (20-832)] 

 Not heard before 2:00 P.M. 
 

   Councilmember Raul Peralez addressed timing concerns regarding body camera and the  

   helicopter footage of Police Department videos. 

 

   Mayor Liccardo observed that iPhones capture images from all angles nowadays and  

   asked how it could be harmful to the City to release video of incidents involving  

   protests where videos filmed by the public are already available on social media, noting  

   that the online clips omit context and relevant information that could lead to  

   understanding of why an officer may have used force and whether it was proper, lawful,  

   or excessive. 

 

   Police Chief Garcia committed to working on a candid process that improves the PD’s  

   transparency, while guaranteeing consistency across the board to address a perception  

   that is slanted by a very narrow view of whatever happened.  

 

   Action: Upon motion by Councilmember Raul Peralez to move approval, seconded  

   by Councilmember Sylvia Arenas, and carried unanimously, Release of Police  

   Department Video Clips Related to Recent Protests, was approved. Staff is directed to  

   return to Council, (and option to come to the Rules Committee if staff needs time to  

   discuss their work plan and workload), with a proposal for what the concept of  

   immediately releasing body worn camera video footage of incidents of great public  

   concern policy outside of our current practices might look like. 

 

   This was modified with Councilmember Peralez’ recommendation of a parallel  

   approach, involving the integration of the reimagining policing in general with the  

   flexibility to accommodate some discrete items on the work plan, including the Rules of  

   Professional Conduct for Officers and the adopted preliminary changes per community  

   concerns, pending consultations, revisions, and feedback on reimagining policing  

   reforms, moving forward.

   Councilmember Maya Esparza highlighted advocacy in reimagining the police force and  

   emphasized the importance of collaboration with key County partners that will inspire  

   buy in, and to create lasting impact, noting it is critical that the County has a seat or  

   more in the process, especially as the City explores deploying mental and behavioral  

   health professionals, and social workers which the County controls. 
 

   Councilmember Esparza sought clarifications on how the City hopes to engage the  

   community from neighborhoods in high crime areas, as many crime victims are people  

   of color. 
 

   City Manager Dave Sykes stated that neighborhood level engagement will be a critical  

   piece of the discussion process from start to finish, and this will be part of the 

   commitment brought to Council on the 25th.

   1. Direct the Independent Police Auditor (IPA) and City Manager to provide Council  

   with specific recommendations for how the IPA would take over investigations of police  

   misconduct from SJPD’s internal affairs that would incorporate the following elements: 

      1) Reallocating resources to introduce investigatory capacity within the IPA by the  

      conclusion of negotiations; 

      2) Enabling the IPA to make factual findings based on its investigations of  

      misconduct allegations; and 

      3) Enabling the IPA to continue to report concerns between her factual findings and  

      the Department’s disciplinary decisions to the Council and public. 

 

   2. Direct the City Attorney, IPA, and City Manager to provide Council with specific  

   recommendations to reform the officer disciplinary appeal process—particularly after a  

   termination decision—to either: 

      1) Identify and implement an alternative to binding arbitration for disciplinary

      2) Reform the arbitration process to enable greater accountability and transparency,  

      in: 

      a. Arbitrator selection;  

      b. Limitation of the arbitrator’s scope of review, such as by requiring deference to the  

      factual findings of the IPA; 

      c. Public disclosure of arbitration decisions; 

      d. Appeal of arbitration decisions to a court of competent jurisdiction; and/or 

      e. Other worthwhile reforms made apparent through discussions with the community

   and responsibilities of the current IPA advisory committee, to include review of some of  

   the IPA work, providing additional insight to the Office of the Independent Police  

   Auditor and allowing for greater transparency. Explore models such as the City of  

   Anaheim Police Review Board, City of Davis’ Police Accountability Commission, and  

   others. 

 

   4. Return to Council in Closed Session to direct City negotiators to commence labor  

   negotiations, to the extent required by the Meyers-Milias Brown Act and related

   experts, consultants, and research—to: 

      a. publicly review use of force policy in the Duty Manual, and explore potential

      b. reimagine public safety response, such as by supplanting SJPD response to many  

      non-criminal matters with civilian response. 

 

   6. Return to the Rules Committee to add to the City Auditor’s workplan an audit of San  

   Jose Police Department expenditures and workload, expanding the scope of the existing  

   staffing audit to incorporate an analysis of the 1.2 million calls for police service, police  

   budgetary allocations, and progress toward civilianization.

   disclosure of body-worn camera footage of incidents of substantial public concern, such  

   as major protests or controversial uses of force: 

      a. Return to Council in closed session to receive assessment from the City Attorney  

      of the requirements of POBAR and other state legal restrictions on release of  

      evidence, and of any legal risks to the City and City taxpayers; 

      b. Return to Council in open session to discuss resources required to rapidly  

      reproduce video that complies with legal requirements, i.e., privacy mandates to  

      obscure faces and identities of people other than the police officers involved in the  

      incident.  

 

   Identify any obstacles created by state law that inhibit our ability to implement  

   straightforward changes to enable greater accountability, and return to Council to  

   determine where the City should take a clear position for legislative advocacy.

 4.4 20-884 Police Department Duty Manual Amendments. - Renumbered from 4.1 (Cont’d)  

   There was no staff presentation for this item.  
 

   Councilmember Maya Esparza expressed concern about banning rubber bullets and  

   sought clarification concerning the tools the PD has left at its disposal that is less deadly  

   or less lethal.  
 

   Police Chief Edgardo Garcia outlined scenarios in which the PD may or may not use  

   rubber bullets on individuals that are committing violence either against officers or folks  

   in the crowd. Removal of these tool will lessen are efficiency in stopping threat of  

   assault on an officer or someone else in a crowd. The PD is not supportive of this  

   because it limits their ability to use less lethal means to stop violence. 
 

   Action: Upon motion by Councilmember Maya Esparza to move approval, seconded  

   by second of Vice Mayor Chappie Jones, and carried unanimously, Police Department  

   Duty Manual Amendments was accepted, including approval of Memorandum from  

   Councilmember Sylvia Arenas, dated August 17, 2020, to:  
 

   1. Direct the City Manager to review and recommend to the Public Safety, Finance, &  

   Strategic Support (PSFSS) Committee additional duty manual changes to improve the  

   Police Department’s interactions with survivors of domestic violence, child abuse,  

   sexual assault, human trafficking, and other vulnerable populations including: 

      a. Align measurable outcomes across law enforcement agencies and community  

      service providers. 

      b. Review all reports of domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and human  

      trafficking for potential high lethality and require officers to provide a police report  

      upon request. 

      c. Ensure a trauma-informed approach to Police Department response by providing  

      survivors with a connection to a community advocate in-person, by phone, or  

      pamphlet before the officer leaves the scene regardless if the survivor asks for  

      referral services. 
 

   2. Add this work to the PSFSS Committee Workplan, as well as the City Manager’s  

   Sexual Assault Response and Strategy Workplan. 

 

   3. Cross list this item to Council for final approval of potential duty manual changes not

   a. Strengthen amendment six, to ban the use of rubber bullets in any crowded setting. 

   b. Ban the use of the Carotid Restraint for any purpose other than self-defense of the  

   officer or defense of another person, and only where the officer or other person’s life is  

   under imminent and serious threat of death--commensurate with the necessary predicate  

   for the use of a firearm. 

 

   Staff was directed to explore coordination on item (2)(a) of the August 14, 2020 memo  

   with the SJPD: 

 

   (2)(a) Strengthen amendment six, to ban the use of rubber bullets in any crowded setting  

 

   It was further agreed, (per Assistant Police Chief Dave Knopf’s clarification of the  

   specific duty manual language), that that item 2b from the Mayor's memo had already  

   been changed and incorporated or stated in the duty manual as follows, as of June 9,  

   2020.  

 

   (2)(b): Ban the use of the Carotid Restraint for any purpose other than self-defense of  

   the officer or defense of another person, and only where the officer or other person’s  

   life is under imminent and serious threat of death--commensurate with the necessary  

   predicate for the use of a firearm. Additional clarification was given that a little bit  

   more study will be required to ensure that the duty manual doesn't require use of more  

   lethal force in certain situations. 

 

   It was discussed, (per Mayor Liccardo’s recommendation) that Council should continue  

   the conversation for one or two weeks to the August 25, 2020 or the September 1, 2020  

   Agenda, (whichever works for Chief Garcia and everyone else), as part of the hearings.  

 

   Upon unanimous consent, it was finally agreed to come back next week after taking it  

   to the Rules Committee to afford the chance to better review the schedule.

   Team were merely bringing forward the policy decisions Council directed staff to  

   implement back in November 2019. Unfortunately, staff has been unable to make these  

   changes until now due to COVID-19. 
 

   Economic Development Assistant Director Nanci Klein noted that a feasibility study  

   looks at cost including land costs, project costs, soft costs compared to what projected  

   revenues could be obtained and analysis of the likely returns, including the costs of  

   money so as to determine if a high-rise project can be built. She responded to questions.

8.1 20-875 Downtown Residential High-Rise Inclusionary Housing Ordinance In… (Cont’d)   

      (ii) The projects would need to obtain Certificates of Occupancy for 80% of dwelling  

      units on or prior to June 30, 2025. 

   (b) Adopt a resolution amending the 2020-2021 Schedule of Fees and Charges  

   (Resolution No. 72737, as amended) to reduce the Inclusionary In Lieu Fee under San  

   José Municipal Code Chapter 5.08 to reflect the schedule in the resolution above for  

   qualifying Downtown High-Rise Residential Developments receiving Certificates of  

   Occupancy for 80% of dwelling units by June 30, 2025. 

 

   Further clarification was given to study projects outside of the downtown area, such as  

   the Public Transportation Corridors including the Rail System, and to explore the  

   feasibility of decreasing fees on those, determined through study by a qualified  

   consultant within the two-year timeline.  

 

   It was also agreed in principle that the projects that are on queue can potentially move  

   forward.  

 

   Additional direction was given to ensure the OED coordinates and collaborates with  

   other departmental staff and come back to Council on timeline and for feedback, as well  

   as and how it’s work interconnects with ongoing work at the Housing Department, City  

   Attorney's Office, and PBCE. 

 

   Emphasis was added by Council that approval of the feasibility study is not to be limited  

   to downtown but should be City wide and at Council-approved costs.  

 

   A friendly amendment request from Councilmember Peralez to the motion was accepted  

   to instead direct staff to come back to Council before December 31, 2020, with report  

   on what the budget implications would be, rather than direction to go forth and embark  

   on feasibility studies, with notation that staff should updates the Council on initial  

   responses in terms of both timing and costs. When Council knows how much this will  

   ultimately cost, it can decide at that point to go forward.

 • OPEN FORUM 

 1.  Paul Soto stated that he had been to hundreds of hours of Council meetings. He never sat in one where 
there was so much reticence, and so much vague language being used in the conduct of the city's 

business. As a citizen, I understood nothing that was said.  2.  Robert Aguirre noted that Items 4.1 to 4.4 were heard jointly, and Council permitted onlyone minute of 
comment from the public. Yet, once that was completed, the items were broken up again and voted on 

those separately. That was unfair to the public.  3.  Kathryn Hedges supports Robert’s remarks. We just don’t seem to be considering teaching the police 
how to de-escalate situations. 4.  Krystal Campsiee: requested a referral back to staff to consider waiving the marijuana business tax for 
medical marijuana card holders. 5. . Victor Jose Vazquez questioned the assumptions that the people were violent, aggressive or offensive 
during the protests relative to the police. 6. . Scott Largent commented that tonight’s was hard meeting to sit through. it doesn't seem like the Police 
Department is going to take responsibility for what happened. you're going to have more people 

protesting out in front of city hall. 7.  Moto G stated that there is no respect for the public. Items 4.1 to 4.4 were supposed to happen after 
2:00PM. It was pushed all the way to 9:00PM without informing the public. 8.  Lucia Garcia stated that we have to define what violence means, because I was in one of these protests 
and somebody threw a bottle of water, that landed near the police officers. They attacked me.  9.  Bobby Gonzalez commented that nearly two thousand officers opening the substation hasn't been a 
priority for a decade due to low staffing levels.  10. D3 resident stated that the meeting’s language was very ambiguous, and today’s questions were the 
same questions that were asked in June. I do appreciate how the Mayor described the inaccuracy of the 

projectiles, so thank you for that. 11. Kristen, (San José resident), is appalled at how much resistance there was for such a minute reform of 
taking away rubber bullets in a crowd setting, not even completely.

reductions for i. Projects that build affordable housing in parallel with its commercial 
development, and, ii. Projects that implement quantifiable and comparable sustainability 
measures b. The creation of an additional fee structure for projects above one million square 
feet. Additionally, included was the memorandum from Councilmember Arenas to 1. To 
ensure no fee exceeds the feasible rate in their geographic zone, limit or waive any 
Commercial Linkage Fees that exceed the “supportable fee levels by prototype and 
geography based on the pro forma analysis.” 2. Direct the City Manager to include

of Title 5 of the San José Municipal Code was adopted with additional direction approved 
from the memorandum from Mayor Liccardo, Vice Mayor Jones, and Councilmembers 
Diep, Davis, and Foley as amended to approve the staff recommendation with the following 
changes:  
 1.For Downtown Office Space over 100,000 square feet, offer 3 options:  •Option 1: $12/per square foot if paid upon Certificate of Occupancy (COO)  
•Option 2: $15/per square foot, paid in phases: - $5 at issuance of Building shell 

COO - $10 payable proportionate to the percentage of rentable building space 
for which there is COO for Tenant Occupancy / Final Building Inspection 
Tenant Improvement (TI) certification, so that fees are paid as leases are 
secured, and prior to employees filling the building.  

•Option 3: Directly build affordable units - Deliver a prescribed number of 
affordable units equivalent to the applicable fee, based on a formula to be 
devised by Housing & OED staff for inclusionary fees on residential 
construction. The ground-breaking of the affordable housing project must 
precede the issuance of a certificate of occupancy on the commercial space.  2.For all office projects less than 100,000 square feet, the fee for the first 40,000 square feet is $0 with direction from #2 of the memorandum from Councilmember 
Khamis to explore justification to adjust the square footage for the exemption to 
50,000 square feet for ease of administration and to simplify calculations. 3.For citywide office projects over 100,000 square feet, provide “Option #2 ($2 at COO and $3 with Tenant Improvements) as well as Option #3 (opportunity to deliver 
affordable units).  4.For industrial projects over 100,000 square feet, provide “Option #2 ($1 at COO and $2 with Tenant Improvements) as well as Option #3 (opportunity to deliver affordable 
units).  5.For hotel projects, staff should provide Option #3 (opportunity to deliver affordable units).  6.In light of rapidly growing vacancy for all retail space, and severe loss of retail employment, set retail fees at $0, regardless of size.  7.All state-licensed Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly should be classified as a commercial use, regardless of what kitchen facilities the individual rooms have. The 
fee would be calculated on the square footage of residential rooms, instead of a 
per-unit IHO fee. This will ensure that amenity space will not be minimized. Staff 
should return to the City Council to verify the per square foot fee within 60 days. Staff 
should also examine how to address similar projects that solely serve disabled 
residents, and projects that include low-income units with additional direction that 
it should not exceed the $6 fee per the Staff’s supplemental memo. 



 
    
 

 City of San José Page 18 September 1, 2020 8.Explore credits for on-site historic preservation, or sustainability at the NetZero standard, not to exceed 20%. The credit could apply directly to this fee, or applied 
against the total fee calculation.  9.Conduct a new feasibility study, to be undertaken no more than two years from fee adoption. If new leasing comp’s are not available, use other available data to assess 
commercial market dynamics such as availability rates and absorption.  10.As discussed in City Council Priority #8 (Universal Fee Framework) create a “single point of contact” within the existing Development Services staff. 

Additionally, also approved were items 5 and 6 from the memorandum from Councilmember 
Peralez to: 5. Return annually prior to the automatic fee increase with a report on the fee 
program. 6. Direct staff to explore: a. Potentially allowing incentives in the form of fee 
reductions for i. Projects that build affordable housing in parallel with its commercial 
development, and, ii. Projects that implement quantifiable and comparable sustainability 
measures (starting with the next cycle) b. The creation of an additional fee structure for 
projects above one million square feet (for next feasibility study) 
Additionally, also approved was item 3 from the memorandum from Councilmember 
Khamis to: 3. Allow developers to whose projects the new fee applies to build or buy 
affordable housing and deed restrict it to ensure the rents remain affordable as an alternative 
to fulfilling the Commercial Linkage Fee requirement, as discussed in Item 1. Option 3 in 
the Memorandum dated August 28, 2020 from Mayor Liccardo, et al, and in Item 6.a.i. of 
the Memorandum dated August 28, 2020 from Councilmember Peralez.  
Additionally, also approved was the memorandum from Councilmember Arenas to direct

Manager to include geographic regions similar to those included in the current Feasibility 
Analysis in the next feasibility study.

connection to a community advocate in-person, by phone, or pamphlet before the officer leaves the 

scene regardless if the survivor asks for referral services.  2. Add this work to the PSFSS Committee Workplan, as well as the City Manager’s Sexual Assault 
Response and Strategy Workplan.  

a. Align measurable outcomes across law enforcement agencies and community service providers.  3. Cross list this item to Council for final approval of potential duty manual changes not limited to

(2)(a) Strengthen amendment six, to ban the use of rubber bullets in any crowded setting  

It was further agreed, (per Assistant Police Chief Dave Knopf’s clarification of the specific duty manual 

language), that that item 2b from the Mayor's memo had already been changed and incorporated or 

stated in the duty manual as follows, as of June 9, 2020.  

(2)(b): Ban the use of the Carotid Restraint for any purpose other than self-defense of the officer or 

defense of another person, and only where the officer or other person’s life is under imminent and 

serious threat of death--commensurate with the necessary predicate for the use of a firearm. Additional 

clarification was given that a little bit more study will be required to ensure that the duty manual doesn't 

require use of more lethal force in certain situations. 
 

Additionally, include referral to IPA when an exception occurs when minors are handcuffed pending 

outcome of the November ballot measure.

   Carlo has not only learned a new job but does it in ways that socially distances him from  

   co-workers and the numerous protocols in place in the City. He is adaptable, maintains a  

   great attitude, and excels on the job.  

 

   Deputy City Manager Kip Harkness, and the leadership team from the City’s  

   Emergency Operations Center provided updates, including a focus on COVID trends in  

   San Jose, City Services, State and Federal Action on Evictions and the Strategic  

   Communications Plan for At-Risk Communities. The City of San José Coronavirus  

   Relief Fund for Arts Organizations is a relief grant program intended to help mitigate  

   COVID-19 related financial impacts by reimbursing San José nonprofit arts and cultural  

   organizations for specific and documentable expenses and income losses due to the  

   pandemic. The fund, which is part of the Federal CARES Act received by the City, will  

   be managed by the Office of Cultural Affairs. Also, the San José Fund, a program  

   offered in partnership between the City of San José’s Office of Cultural Affairs and the  

   Center for Cultural Innovation (CCI), is designed to provide relief funding for artists.  

   The San José Fund will distribute $208,000 in the form of grants. Individual artists and  

   sole proprietor arts businesses can receive up to $2,000 to help mitigate COVID-19  

   related financial impacts.

 Attorney’s Office to return to Council with the appropriate action, as applicable:

 surplus in their October budget update, at least 50% of that surplus will be set aside to  

 our Budget Stabilization Fund, until an amount equal to 15% of the General Fund  

 balance has been achieved or be used to pay municipal debt. 

  (2) A standing commission shall be created consisting of appointed residents of San  

 José to provide oversight of any ballot measures or policy proposals proposed or  

 endorsed by the City that result in tax increases or additional revenue. The commission  

 shall produce a public report annually to certify whether the Council has allocated  

 dollars as promised when the measure or ordinance was proposed. 

  (3) Prior to the start of the annual budget season and priority setting session, the  

 intergovernmental team shall report to Council about the latest trends and chatter  

 coming from Sacramento and Washington about potential policy changes and funding  

 opportunities relevant to municipalities so that we may strategically align our priorities  

 and resources to maximize benefits for San José residents. 

  (4) Direct the City Auditor to commence regular performance audits of three key  

 departments that are constituent-facing - such as Police, Fire, Planning, Housing,  

 Transportation, Public Works, Environmental Services, and Parks - every year

   cleanups and blight remediation by adding up to an additional $3,000,000, to be  

   completed on or before December 31, 2020.  

      a. Where legally possible, prioritize the supplemental funding for those bids for  

      cleanup contracts under the pending Request for Bids to contractors hiring  

      unemployed and homeless residents.  

      b. Notwithstanding prior efforts, prioritize the most needed and most highly visible,  

      high-traffic locations—those “sore spots” that have had the greatest impact on our  

      residents’ perception of their community for cleaning with this supplemental funding. 
 

   2. At the September 22nd public Council hearing, inform the Council about the status of  

   various areas for which partner agencies have responsibility, including:  

      a. Freeway and highway trash:  

         i. The response of Caltrans to City inquiries regarding the geographic allocation of  

         District 4 funding for trash pickup and litter abatement. Please determine, in  

         particular, whether funds for cleanup on freeways in Santa Clara County appear  

         proportionate (based on the population and lane miles) to that of other Bay Area  

         counties, including any supplemental state funding from the most recent budget  

         year. COUNCIL AGENDA: September 22, 2020 ITEM: 3.6 

          ii. Whether the public response of Caltrans spokesperson Matt Rocco to Caltrans’  

         inability to respond adequately to blight at the 280 /Almaden Caltrans-owned site  

         in the September 11, 2020 Mercury News—that the agency “takes the health and  

         safety of its employees very seriously” reflects whether the agency is actually  

         declining to deploy Caltrans staff for cleanups for health-related reasons. Further  

         determine—and invite Caltrans to explain—why the health risks for trash  

         abatement outdoors should be considered more serious than the risks undertaken  

         by the thousands of taxpaying San Jose residents working daily in busy kitchens,  

         hospitals, laundries, and driving buses.

         iii. An update on code enforcement activity for adjacent properties, with an  

         emphasis on properties with multiple violations.  

         iv. An update on the use of technology and other strategies to help deter future  

         illegal dumping, trespassing, and other activity at the Monterey Road at Emado  

         Ave illegal dumping site.  

      c. Creeks Waterway and clean-up collaboration of Valley Water with the City of San  

         José, and planned outreach and cleaning efforts. 

   3. During the planned December Study Session, report to Council regarding:  

      a. the status of long-overdue efforts to eliminate barriers to more widespread and  

      frequently usage of the 311 app—including repeated sign-in requirements—and an  

      update about how changes to the app have adversely affected public usage.  

      b. the steps that the Emergency Operations Center is taking to verify the quality of  

      the work and the effectiveness of our efforts—including that of private contractors—  

      in cleaning and beautifying San Jose neighborhoods.  

      c. whether opening public bidding to other tow operators outside the City of San Jose  

      will enable more responsive service in clearing abandoned vehicles from our  

      neighborhoods.  

      d. an update on code enforcement activities, including how many staff are actively  

      conducting code enforcement inspections and the percent of code enforcement  

      services that have been fully restored to pre shelter-in-place levels. 

 

   This was addended with Memorandum from Vice Mayor Jones, dated 9/18/2020, to:

      c. Recommendation 3: Explore a Community Opportunity to Purchase  

      Program/Ordinance:  

         (1) Limit the range of properties subject to the program to those most suitable for  

         community ownership by:  

            i. As San Francisco has, exempting single-family homes and duplexes  

            ii. Impose an upper limit on the number of units (e.g., 50 units) due to the  

            infeasibility of a community-based organization obtaining access to financing a  

            large transaction  

 

   (2) Ensure property owners receive market value—as determined through open  

   bidding—particularly through a right-of-first-refusal process  

   (3) Minimize the process delay in the sale timeline, taking into consideration a seller’s  

   vulnerability to market movement, interest rate volatility and risk, and impacts of delay  

   on property valuations  

   (4) Establish criteria to restrict eligibility to those nonprofit qualified community  

   developers that have the capacity to successfully transact a community purchase  

   (5) If any for-profit entities shall be allowed to participate in the community purchase  

   process, impose strict criteria to avoid conflicts of financial interest with community,  

   city, and program goals  

   (6) Establish a pilot period with an end date to return to Council with results and  

   evaluation after implementation, upon engaging stakeholders including but not limited  

   to affordable housing developers, community organizations, landowners, real estate  

   brokers, and lenders. 

 

   This was modified with approval of item #5 from Councilmember Khamis’s memo to: 

 

   5) Return to the Community and Economic Development Committee, with a  

   cross-reference to the full Council, after the framework for the COPA is developed to  

   provide an update and provide any further guidance that may be required.

Action: The San José Better Bike Plan 2025 was accepted, including the joint memorandum from Mayor 

Sam Liccardo and Councilmembers Esparza, Peralez, Carrasco and Davis, dated October 2, 2020, with 

direction as follows: 1. Direct staff to assess temporary COVID-19 related street closures, and explore 
opportunities to close them permanently to motor vehicle traffic, as well as conduct a 

citywide review of additional opportunities to modify streets for bicycle and pedestrian 

only use. Report back to the Transportation and Environment Committee in early 2021. 2. When staff updates Council Policy 5-1: Transportation Analysis Policy look for ways to 
integrate the San José Better Bike Plan 2025 (PLAN) into that process in a way that 

accelerates PLAN implementation when new development projects are considered. 3. Aggressively pursue regional, state and federal dollars through the Measure B Active 
Transportation funding, the State Active Transportation Program (ATP) and Affordable 

Housing Sustainable Community grant programs, the Highway Safety Improvement 

Program (HSIP) and other grant programs to implement the PLAN. Further, as the Bay 

Area contemplates a regional transportation measure for 2022 or beyond, ensure that 

regional complete street and active transportation dollars remain a priority, and that San 

José is well-positioned to access that funding.

5.1 (Cont’d.)  4. Continue to coordinate paving program --that is already supported by Measure T, 
Measure B and Senate Bill 1 funding -- with PLAN implementation in a way that 

prioritizes “low-stress” on-street bike facilities in addition to overall miles paved. 5. To advance the equity components of the PLAN focused on education and 
encouragement programs that support a thriving and equitable bicycle culture in San 

José, staff should work with the Mayor’s Office of Strategic Partnerships, to identify and 

pursue philanthropic funding. This effort should also be coordinated with our 

community-based organizations and outreach partners. 6. Refocus Equity goal and metrics on improving the mobility of low-income residents by 
prioritizing provision of safe, high-quality bike facilities serving high-need 

neighborhoods and destinations. 7. Reconsider how we could forge better continuous east-west connections--via high-quality 
buffered or protected bike lanes--from neighborhoods in East and South-Central San José 

to job and education centers in Downtown and North San José. 

a. In particular, where appropriate studies reveal a safe approach for doing so, focus 

should be given to finding high-quality east-west routes in the center of the City, 

between the cluster of proposed routes along Brokaw in the North, and Story in 

the South. 

b. Prioritize those east-west connections in future capital expenditures. 8. For the Spring 2021 report to the Transportation & Environment Committee, DOT staff 
should bring forward performance measures to track annual progress of the three PLAN 

goals of Safety, Mode Share, and Equity.

Action: Upon motion by Councilmember Johnny Khamis, seconded by Mayor Sam Liccardo and carried 

unanimously, the joint memorandum from Councilmembers Jimenez, Peralez, Carrasco, Esparza, and 

Arenas, dated October 21, 2020 was accepted as revised, to (1) Accept the City Clerk’s 

recommendations;  
(2) Refer Redistricting Commission changes to the San José Board of Fair Campaign and Political 

Practices to evaluate and bring back to Council for consideration before final appointment of 

commissioners. The Commission should consider holding a special meeting in November to evaluate 

reforms. Reforms should include prohibiting communication between Commissioners and the 

Mayor/Councilmembers, as well as candidates for those offices, campaign staff, and their spouses, as 

well as providing for strict disclosure requirements of all communications between Commissioners and 

outside parties to ensure transparency. Reforms should ensure: (2)(a.) Increase community participation 
and communication with historically underserved and underrepresented communities through extensive 

and effective community engagement, based on best practices: (i.) Meetings in each Council District -- 

per Brennan Center for Justice and consistent with the 2010 San José Redistricting process. 

 

(ii.) Multiple meetings in all 3 common languages: Spanish, Vietnamese, English. (iii.) Extensive and 

effective noticing for the public -- including ensuring that notices are placed in newspapers of record -- 

per Brennan Center for Justice (iv.) Include Vietnamese, Spanish, and English papers for language 

specific meetings. (v.) Hold an additional public hearing on the subject of redistricting principles 

proposed in today's action. (vi.) Provide free childcare options for those who need it to participate in 

public hearings – when possible under public health guidelines. (vii.) Allow sufficient time after public 

hearings to incorporate feedback.

(b.) Serve the City Charter’s stated goal under Article 403 that “The membership of the Commission 

shall be representative of the ethnic make-up of the City at large, to the extent practicable” and ensure 

sufficient resources to meet Council direction and best practices: (i.) Direct the City Clerk to produce a 

budget and plan to address these community needs -- including staffing and consulting needs. (ii.) Direct 

the City Manager's Office to bring forward sufficient funding in the Mid-Year budget, for Council 

approval.  3. Provide an open and accessible website with key information available to the public -- including: 
listing commissioners, data used, and access to data. Hearing notices, recordings, transcripts, and lives 

stream links.  4. Reaffirm and clarify equity principles in Redistricting Commission criteria list: (a.) Direct the City 
Attorney to submit an amicus brief in ongoing litigation to prevent the Trump Administration from 

excluding undocumented community members from census data that will form the basis of redistricting 

data. (b.) Direct the Redistricting Commission to: (i.) Create Districts that provide racial minorities with 

an equal opportunity to participate in the political process, and that do not dilute or diminish their ability 

to elect candidates of choice whether alone or in coalitions with others -- per Brennan Center for Justice. 

(ii.) Educate Commission members on the importance of avoiding proposed maps that would result in 

""stacking"", ""cracking"", or ""packing"" communities of color and thereby reducing their voice in municipal 

governance 

AND 

Approve the memorandum from Mayor Liccardo, dated October 9, 2020, as revised, to (1) Accept the 

City Clerk’s recommendations; and (2) Adopt the reforms recommended by California Common Cause 

to maximize the diversity, openness and effectiveness of San José’s Redistricting Commission process 

as detailed below. 1. Hold an open application process: Let all San José residents apply to serve on the 

commission. Construct an open and public process that makes applicants’ applications – their resumes 

and answers to short essay questions – known to the public. Create a website where members of the 

public can submit public comment on applications. Require councilmembers to appoint someone from 

the pool of people who apply from their district.  CA Common Cause can provide useful examples of 

applications from other city and county redistricting commissions and consult on designing the 

application process. 2. Eliminate conflicts of interest: Prohibit the appointment of an elected official's 

family members, employees, current or past campaign staffers, or current or past campaign consultants; 

current and past candidates and officeholders; registered city lobbyists; and major campaign donors (e.g. 

$500+).  CA Common Cause can provide disqualifying conflict of interest criteria from other 

redistricting commissions. Disqualifying conflict of interest criteria of this kind are used by the state 

commission and commissions in many cities and counties, including Menlo Park, Oakland, Los Angeles 

County, and San Diego County. 3. Ensure diversity on the commission: Require elected officials to 

make their appointments ""provisional"" and public for a two-week period, so the City Clerk or City 

Attorney can provide an evaluation of whether the proposed appointees as a whole would compose a 

commission that  

is in fact racially/ethnically representative of the City. Require that the final appointments be made 

together at a noticed council meeting so that councilmembers can deliberate and make adjustments as 

needed to ensure diversity. 4. Enable public input on commissioner selections before they are final: 

Permit the public to comment on the proposed commissioners during this provisional period. 5. Ban 

closed-door, backroom communications: Increase independence and public trust by prohibiting  

 

(Item Continued on the Next Page) 



 
 
 

 City of San José Page 13 October 27, /2020 
3.5 (Cont’d.)  

commissioners from having ex parte communications on redistricting. Such bans have been adopted by 

the state commission and by several large cities in California, such as Long Beach and Sacramento. 

Adopt the provisions for California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission in state code section 8253.a3, 

which states: “Commission members and staff may not communicate with or receive communications 

about redistricting matters from anyone outside of a public hearing. This paragraph does not prohibit 

communication between commission members, staff, legal counsel and consultants retained by the 

commission.” Require all communication with commissioners concerning redistricting from elected 

officials to be made orally during public comment at a commission meeting or in written comment 

submitted to the commission and published online. 6. Prevent interference with the commission’s work: 

Permit removal of a commissioner by the appointing elected official for good cause only (e.g. health 

problems or moving out of San Jose) and with confirmation via a majority vote of the redistricting 

commission. 7. Direct city staff to return with options for placing a charter amendment on the 2022 

ballot to create an independent redistricting commission, which would adopt council district boundaries 

in all future redistricting cycles. Staff should work with California Common Cause to identify best 

practices recommendations and model charter language from other California cities.

evaluate the use of drones and other similar technology available to SJPD as an 

enforcement tool during peak firework seasons and return to Council with findings

celebrations. 3. While staff engages regional partners to leverage illegal fireworks mitigation 
resources and programs staff should also: 

a. Work with the Office of Administration, Policy, and Intergovernmental 

Relations to collaborate with county, state and federal partners on 

legislation that bans the use of fireworks statewide and increases the 

prosecution of violators. 

b. Engage with neighboring cities such as Morgan Hill and Gilroy to 

encourage the banning of fireworks Countywide, and prevent fireworks sold 

or used in these cities from entering San Jose. 

c. Search for potential state and federal funding sources that will enable the 

City to further invest in enforcement mechanisms and programs to deter the 

use of fireworks. 4. Direct the City Manager to evaluate potential funding for the reinstatement of the 
Fireworks Hotspot Police Enforcement pilot for Fourth of July 2021. 5. Evaluate current educational campaigns for cultural competency to guarantee that 
educational efforts are targeted and appropriate for various cultures and ethnic groups.

Knowles offered support, including a need for mass transit and fewer cars on the road. Josh Quigley 

expressed a need to adapt to existing climate risks and the need for urban greening. 

 

Action: Upon motion by Councilmember Dev Davis, seconded by Councilmember Sergio Jimenez and 

carried unanimously, the update was accepted, with the inclusion of the joint memorandum from Mayor 

Sam Liccardo, Councilmember Dev Davis, Councilmember Sergio Jimenez and Councilmember Raul 

Peralez, dated November 13, 2020 to accept the Climate Smart San José status update with the following 

recommendations: 1. Through the budget process, return to Council with a long-term strategy to fund staffing 
for Climate Smart San José implementation. This direction should align with prior 

Council direction to pursue philanthropic and regional, state, and federal funding – to 

ensure our climate action work persists beyond the American Cities Climate Challenge 

grant timeline. Work with the Mayor’s Office of Strategic Partnerships and other partners 

to identify and pursue foundation funding opportunities. 2. Pursue agency funding (BAAQMD, MTC, and CARB among others), and/or other 
revenue, to support a Transportation Demand Management coordinator to manage the 

City employee transportation benefits program, and make campaigns to reduce single occupancy 

commute trips within the City of San José’s employee population, and that of 

other San José based large employers. 3. Explore the development of a zero-emission neighborhood (ZEN) pilot focused on the 
nexus of climate and equity where we can rapidly design and demonstrate whole 

neighborhood climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that are scalable in 

neighborhoods throughout the city. This effort should include: 

a. Review of similar programs in other cities, funding sources, and impacts and 

lessons learned; 

b. An approach for community engagement that leverages the Climate Smart 

Community Engagement Roadmap adopted in June 2020 that includes equity-focused strategies for 

residents, community-based organizations, and businesses; 

c. A neighborhood that has historically suffered disproportionate impact from 

environmental pollution, e.g., pollutants from a nearby industrial zone, airport, or 

freeway;

d. Explicitly include the development of a neighborhood microgrid with sufficient 

scale to provide resilience against PSPS, wildfire, and other emergencies that 

interrupt electricity transmission or distribution for a significant duration. 4. Explore leveraging the recent Climate Action Corps partnership with the Governor’s 
Office––announced earlier this Fall––to support community engagement and data 

management efforts for Climate Smart San José implementation, and climate adaptation 

and mitigation strategies – like tree planting to address urban heat island effects and 

provide green storm water infrastructure, and providing energy-savings measures for low-income 

families. Further, collaborate with the Mayor’s Office to explore partnerships 

with San José State University, local community colleges and career oriented high 

schools to offer opportunities for service learning students to volunteer and participate in 

local climate action work that is being led by the Climate Action Corps fellows 

throughout the city.

 ADJOURNMENT 

 

The Council of the City of San José adjourned at 9:02 p.m. in memory of Melchor Landin Ramirez, an icon 

that started a popular bakery in East San José. He founded Mexico Bakery, a small, immigrant owned

bakeries and help the community. Melchor will be missed but never forgotten.
