## Background

San Jose 市政会议记录

## Goal

提高政务公开的透明度和可查询性

"The goal is parse a large dataset of public meetings (i.e. City Council, School Board, Planning Commission) and surface critical insights to everyday community members. 

This may involve imagine recognition, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis. You do not need to be experienced in all three, in order to contribute to this project.

Agendas are often stored as PDFs so we need help running image recognition on the PDFs. 

An example use case: we want to analyze the structure of each meeting and serialize the meeting structure so we can pass it to other software applications. 
Another example use case: we want to analyze the meeting contents so we can tag meetings. A user may want to subscribe to meetings that talk about housing so we need to tag meetings that talk about housing in the agenda."

The goal for this role is to build out the NLP capabilities in processing text documents to accurately and succinctly capture relevant information on key words.
